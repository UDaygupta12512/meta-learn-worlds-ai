# 🌍 Meta-Learn Worlds AI

**Meta-Learn Worlds AI** is an experimental AI project focused on **meta-learning** — enabling models to *learn how to learn* across multiple tasks and environments.  
The goal is to explore how intelligent systems can **generalize, adapt quickly, and transfer knowledge** instead of being trained for only one fixed task.

> 🚧 This project is under active development.

## 🧠 What is Meta-Learning?

Meta-learning trains models using **multiple tasks** so they can:
- Adapt quickly to new, unseen tasks  
- Learn from fewer examples  
- Transfer prior experience across environments  

Instead of learning *one task*, the model learns **how to learn tasks efficiently**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore **meta-learning and multi-task learning** concepts  
- Build reusable experiment pipelines  
- Enable fast adaptation across simulated environments  
- Experiment with AI generalization and task transfer  
- Provide a foundation for research, demos, or academic projects  

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Multi-task / meta-learning setup  
- 🧪 Experiment-driven design  
- 📊 Support for evaluation and benchmarking  
- 🧠 Modular architecture for future models  
- 🌐 Frontend-ready structure (React + Vite)
