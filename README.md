# 🌍 Meta-Learn Worlds AI

**Meta-Learn Worlds AI** is an experimental AI project focused on **meta-learning** — enabling models to *learn how to learn* across multiple tasks and environments.  
The goal is to explore how intelligent systems can **generalize, adapt quickly, and transfer knowledge** instead of being trained for only one fixed task.

> 🚧 This project is under active development.

## 🧠 What is Meta-Learning?

Meta-learning trains models using **multiple tasks** so they can:
- Adapt quickly to new, unseen tasks  
- Learn from fewer examples  
- Transfer prior experience across environments  

Instead of learning *one task*, the model learns **how to learn tasks efficiently**.
